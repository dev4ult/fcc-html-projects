        <h3 id="headline">Here's a timeline of Saber de Katz's life on weekend</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>5 AM</strong> - Wake up from a dream that was 10 times better than his real life. After he forget about his imaginary life, then he goes sitting on a chair and turning on a laptop on his desk just for earning something
            (might) valuable from it (he thinks), every day.
          </li>
          <li><strong>9 AM</strong> - After he is done with his laptop, then he goes for work out.</li>
          <li><strong>11 AM</strong> - 2 hours break time.</li>
          <li><strong>1 PM</strong> - Continuing on his laptop. Doing some programming project or keep learning on a programming language.</li>
          <li><strong>3 PM</strong> - 1 hour break time. Probably scrolling on social media or watching an anime.</li>
          <li><strong>4 PM</strong> - Continue with his laptop.</li>
          <li><strong>6.30 PM</strong> - A little break time, then he goes on with his laptop until his sleep time</li>
          <li><strong>10 PM</strong> - He goes to sleep to continue with his imaginary life that he thinks 10 times better than his real life.</li>
        </ul>
